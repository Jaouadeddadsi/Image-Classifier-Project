## Project: Create an Image Classifier

### Description
In this project, I built a python application that can train an image classifier on a dataset, then predict new images using the trained model. The project was devided to two parts.

#### Part 2 - Developing an Image Classifier with Deep Learning
In this first part of the project, I implemened an image classifier with PyTorch.

#### Part 2 - Building the command line application
 Build a pair of Python scripts that run from the command line to train an image classifier and to predict new images using the trained model.
